            <h3> What is a yurt?</h3>
            <p>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.<br>
                Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a <br>
                roof dome that can be opened.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
            <p>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and<br>
                gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity<br>
                and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom<br>
                facilities are located in the lodge.

            <h3> What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for<br>
                changing weather with layers of clothing. It's also helpful to<br>
                bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
